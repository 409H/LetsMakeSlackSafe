            <ul>
                <li>Disables use of people using Slackbot to remind channels.</li>
                <li>Disables people from sending messages as anyone through the open legacy tokens api.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can whitelist the <code>bot_ids</code> in <code>config.ini</code> that are allowed to post
                        messages.
                    </li>
                    <li>This will also reduce the attack vector of people creating apps and messaging everyone to look more
                        legit.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Periodically remind you to enable 2fa if it's not enabled.</li>
                <li>Posts warnings of URLs in messages if they're currently being tracked in <a
                        href="https://etherscamdb.info">EtherScamDB</a>.</li>
                <li>Archive the auto-deleted messages to an archive private channel for admins to look at.</li>
                <li>A quick "Deploy to Heroku" so you can get on with business and have this running in the background,
                    doing its thing.

            <h3>What are commands?</h3>
            <p>
                In the <code>config.ini</code> file, you will have a <code>admin[userid]</code> item, this will allow you
                to send <code>+cmd</code> within the <code>@Slackbot</code> channel to tell SafeSlack to do things, like
                update a fresh copy of <a href="https://etherscamdb.info/data/scams.json" target="_blank">EtherScamDB tracked scam domains</a>
                so that messages with these links are auto-flagged.

            <h3>What's happening now in public channels</h3>
            <p>
                Below you will see an example of a bad actor using Slack API to send a message to a public channel
                as any user (notice "MyEtherWallet" isn't a listed user or app) and make an 'attachment' with a link
                to what looks like myetherwallet.com - but it's not. It's a link to another domain, which usually is
                a MyEtherWallet clone (or ICO website clone) modified to steal users private keys. This is also
                happening within the <code>@Slackbot</code> channel.

            <h3>With the SafeSlack tool</h3>
            <p>
                Below you will see the same message being sent - but because the bot isn't whitelisted (in <code>config.ini</code>)
                the message gets auto-deleted before anyone has the chance to read and click it - it also gets
                auto-deleted within the <code>@Slackbot</code> channel.
